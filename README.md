The object of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own color discs. Press the buttons of the desired column and it will fall to the next available slot. Each player can make one move at a time. The game will stop once the first player has won and give you an option to reset. You can start a new game at any time.
